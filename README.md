## Introduction

You can use any front-end framework or libraries you want on the [Volusion][] platform, as long as you interface with the [Volusion][] API. This [AngularJS][] theme project, however, has been created in aim to streamline the design and development of themes available in the [Volusion][] theme store. This project is intended to get you up and running in no time, so you can focus on what matters most.


## Getting started

First, you need a [GitHub][] account. A free account will do you just fine.


### Installation

Next, unless you're a git wizard (a gizard?), you'll want to also install a git client. There are a number to choose from, but the official [GitHub][] ones are actually pretty nice.
* [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)
* [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)

_Windows Pro Tip: In the GitHub for Windows client, select Tools >> Options and change your default shell to Git Bash. Select your project, hit the Tools and Options button and then "open a shell here" or just hit the back tick key `\`` as a shortcut. You now have an excellent Git shell with your Git credentials already stored._

_Another Windows Pro Tip: Add "C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_xxx\bin" to your PATH user environment variable to gain access to common *nix commands in your Windows Command Prompt without installing msysgit or cygwin._

### Create a branch

As a general practice, you want to stay off the main "master" branch of the repository. This means you'll need to create a new branch for your theme and work on top of that.


#### In the client

Click the branch button at the top where it says "master" and type the name of your theme in the text box. Hit ENTER or click the "+ create branch: xxx" button to create and switch to your new branch.


#### In the shell

```bash
$ git checkout -b my-theme
Switched to branch 'my-theme'
```
